  =============================================================
  In mathematics, the factorial of integer n is written as n!. It is equal to the product of n and every integer preceding it. For example: 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120

  Your mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer n and returns the value of n!.

  You are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the non-negative range, return null, nil or None (return an empty string "" in C and C++). For non-negative numbers a full length number is expected for example, return 25! = "15511210043330985984000000" as a string.

  MY SOLUTION
*/

function factorial(n){
  let answer = 1;
  for(i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    answer = answer * i;
  }
  return answer.toString();
}
